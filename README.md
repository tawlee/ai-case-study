**How is your company performing based on these metrics?**

As for IDB Bank, “On May 24, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a consent order against Israel Discount Bank of New York. The bank did not admit or deny any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to, among other things, deficiencies and weaknesses in its AML/Countering the Financing of Terrorism program” (De la Cruz et al., 2023).

While the core metrics for assessing a company's risk management and compliance performance are valuable tools, it's important to exercise caution when interpreting them in isolation. In the case of IDB Bank and the consent order, it's crucial to avoid making definitive conclusions about the bank's overall risk management effectiveness based solely on this specific incident.Here's why:

1. Limited Scope: The consent order focuses on specific deficiencies within the AML/CFT program, not the entire risk management framework. It's important to remember that risk management encompasses a broad range of areas beyond AML/CFT.
2. Self-Reporting: The fact that the bank self-reported the deficiencies and entered into a consent order suggests proactive engagement with regulators, which could be seen as a positive sign of their commitment to compliance.
3. Remedial Measures: The consent order outlines specific steps the bank must take to address the identified deficiencies. Implementing these measures effectively could demonstrate their commitment to improvement.

**Performance Relative to Competitors:** Based on the limited information available, it's difficult to give a definitive assessment of IDB's overall financial health. However, there are a few indicators that can tell us how IDB Bank is performing relative to competitors IDB Bank as of December 31, 2023, is definitely helpful for understanding its financial health at that point in time. Here's a breakdown of what each metric tells us:

*Positive indicators:*
-	Total Assets: $12,219 million indicates a sizable asset base, suggesting financial stability and potential lending capacity.
-	Capital Ratio (CET-1): 14.6% is well above the minimum regulatory requirement, suggesting strong capital adequacy and ability to absorb potential losses.

*Neutral indicators:*
-	Total Customer Deposits: $8,064 million is a moderate level of customer deposits, which could be a function of their target market or focus areas.
